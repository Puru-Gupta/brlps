## Big Data Processing Pipeline with R and Apache Spark

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates a **robust data processing pipeline** using **R and Apache Spark's R interface**, efficiently handling and analyzing large datasets. Developed End-to-End Rshiny Dashboard that help in monitoring of CBO performace at State level, 38 District and 534 Block Level
## Impact:

## üîπ Key Features  

1. **Big Data Handling:**  
- Utilized **Parquet files** for efficient storage and **Apache Arrow** for optimized data transport and analysis.  

2. **Database Connectivity:**  
- Connected **Oracle & MS SQL databases** with R and fetched data using SQL queries.  

3. **Lazy Data Processing:**  
- Implemented **lazy evaluation** to avoid full memory loading, enabling on-demand access.  

4. **High-Volume Data Processing:**  
- Successfully processed **14+ million records**, leveraging **complex data pre-processing** 
techniques for:  
  - Data cleaning  
  - Data transformation  
  - Statistical analysis  
- Used **Arrow objects** for **faster in-memory computation**.  

5. **Data Quality Assessment:**  
- Performed **data profiling, outlier detection, consistency checks**.  
- Applied **data cleansing & standardization** techniques to improve data integrity.  

6. **Master Data Objects for Dashboards:**  
- Created multiple **master Arrow data objects** to generate a **comprehensive dashboard**.  

7. **CBO Operations Monitoring:**  
Structured dashboard modules covering:  
- **CBO Formation** üè¢  
- **Membership Management** üë•  
- **Financial Transactions** üí∞  
- **Cadre Presence** üèÖ  
- **Other critical performance metrics** 

8. Analysed District/Block wise/Panchayat/Village wise Community Finance by Loan Types, CLFs, VOs & SHGs. 
9. Tracks SHGs' loan & their repayemt and SHGs Savings & Loan Account Analysis. 
10. Used Advanced clustering techniques, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group SHGs based on their loan repayment behavior and performance. Found best and poor performing SHGs. Helped State in their decision making.

11. **Automated Reporting:**  
- Implemented **Markdown reports** for customizable insights on various indicators & metrics.  

12. **Automated Dashboard Refresh:**  
- Configured **a cron job** to update the dashboard **twice daily**.
